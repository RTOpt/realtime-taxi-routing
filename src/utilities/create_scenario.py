        Input:
        ------------
            network : Network object
                The road network, including nodes representing stop points.
            cust_node_hour : float
                Average number of customers per node per hour (mean of the Poisson process).
            start_ID : int
                Starting ID for the generated trip requests.
            start_time : float
                The time in seconds after which requests are received.
            durations : dict
                A nested dictionary containing travel times between nodes, with outer keys as origin node IDs
                and inner keys as destination node IDs.
            sim_time : float, optional
                The total time in seconds for receiving requests. Defaults to 3600 (1 hour).
            hour_fare : float, optional
                Fare paid for serving request per hour of travel. Defaults to 80$.
            time_window : int, optional
                The time window in minutes within which customers are willing to be picked up after their
                ready time. Defaults to 5 minutes.
            advance_notice : int, optional
                The time in min before the ready time that customers call to make a request.
                Defaults to 30 minutes.
            known_portion : int, optional
                The percentage of requests that are known in advance (between 0 and 100). Defaults to 0.
            nb_requests : int, optional
                Maximum number of requests to generate. If None, generates requests up to sim_time.

        Output:
        ------------
            trips : list
                List of generated RideRequest objects.
